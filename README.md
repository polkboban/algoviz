# ALGOVIZ

An interactive **Algorithm Visualizer** built with **Vue.js** to help users understand various algorithms through step-by-step execution and animations.

##  Features

✅ **Algorithm Selection** – Choose different algorithms from a dropdown menu.  
✅ **Step-by-Step Execution** – Play, pause, and step forward/backward.  
✅ **Dynamic Input** – Enter custom data for sorting, page replacement, etc.  
✅ **Visual Animations** – Highlight affected elements dynamically.  
✅ **Performance Metrics** – Display time complexity and comparisons.  

##  Tech Stack

- **Vue 3 (Composition API)** – Core framework  
- **Pinia** – State management for algorithm steps  
- **Tailwind CSS** – UI styling  
- **Canvas or SVG** – Graph-based algorithms visualization  

##  Algorithms Implemented

### Sorting Algorithms
- ✅ Bubble Sort  
- ✅ Insertion Sort  
- ✅ Merge Sort  
- ✅ Heap Sort  

### Page Replacement Algorithms
- ✅ FIFO (First-In-First-Out)  
- ✅ LRU (Least Recently Used)  

### Graph Algorithms
- ✅ BFS (Breadth-First Search)  
- ✅ DFS (Depth-First Search)  

##  Installation & Setup
